Towards a journey of learning how to make machines learn

## Day 0 : November 18th , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : I have setup all the things I needed to complete this challenge and also completed chosing the projects I will work on. Mainly clearning my HD, reinstalling Windows on an SSD, setting up dual boot ubuntu, Anaconda to generate separate environments, main ML packages and cloning the github projects into my local space. 

**Thoughts** : Hope this will be exiciting, I look forward to learn Artificial Intelligence in a more effective way .

## Day 1 : November 19th , 2018

**Today's Progress** : Working on Principal Component Analysis feature reduction with Iris and other datasets, learning about the curse of dimensionality.

**Thoughts** : Let's get this

## Day 2 : November 20th , 2018

**Today's Progress** : Working with Constituency parsing with the NLTK Library and studying ngrams and bayes theorem. 

## Day 3 : November 21st  , 2018

**Today's Progress** : Moving onto Dependency Parsing with NLTK and studying from the AI: A modern approach book. 

## Day 4 : November 22nd  , 2018

**Today's Progress** : Studying ngrams, spam vs ham in text recognition for emails and a K-NN classifier implementation

## Day 5 : November 23rd  , 2018

**Today's Progress** : TODO.

## Day 5 : November 24th  , 2018

**Today's Progress** : TODO.

## Day 5 : November 25th  , 2018

**Today's Progress** : TODO.

**Thoughts of the week** : The builtin tools or models we use are also just algorithms , they are not any rocket science , learning ML become more fun when these algorithms are implemented from scratch , it was really a great experience .
